A minimal yet powerful file manager built with Node.js and Express.js that allows users to browse, read, and create .txt files directly from the browser. Designed with a clean and responsive UI using Tailwind CSS, this application demonstrates dynamic file system operations, templating with EJS, and real-time rendering of file contents. Ideal for learning how server-side rendering and basic file handling works in Node.js.
